/*
 * RNS over BLE — broadcast-first interface.
 *
 * A shared BLE advertising medium is, physically, a broadcast RNS interface:
 * one connectionless transmission is heard by every device in range, and RNS's
 * own addressing decides who acts on each packet. That makes group traffic
 * efficient — an announce, or a packet to a GROUP/PLAIN destination, is aired
 * ONCE and reaches all N members, instead of N separate point-to-point sends
 * (the limitation of GATT-only designs like torlando-tech/ble-reticulum).
 *
 * This interface therefore broadcasts every outgoing packet that fits the
 * connectionless cap, and falls back to a point-to-point (GATT) send only for
 * packets too large to advertise. Reassembly + selective-repeat (NACK)
 * reliability for the chunked broadcast live in the underlying radio (Aurora's
 * BleService); RNS provides confidentiality/auth on top, so the BLE transport
 * itself needs no pairing.
 *
 * The [RnsBleRadio] abstraction keeps this file free of Flutter/BLE imports so
 * the broadcast routing is unit-testable; the on-device binding to BleService
 * lives in lib/connections/bluetooth/ble_rns_radio.dart.
